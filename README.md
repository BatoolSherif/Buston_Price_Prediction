# Buston_Price_Prediction
This code performs house price prediction using various regression models on the Boston House Price dataset. The dataset contains features of houses in Boston and their corresponding prices. The code evaluates their performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) metrics. Additionally, it also visualizes the predictions of each model compared to the actual prices.

The models that are used in the code:
1. Linear Regression with Polynomial Features
2. Support Vector Regressor (SVR) with a linear kernel
3. Random Forest Regressor
4. Gradient Boosting Regressor
5. Lasso Regression
6. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model
